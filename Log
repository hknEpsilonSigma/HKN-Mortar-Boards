2/15/19
Colin, Richard
Setup Git repository
Installed CCS and XCTU
Connected to XBee3 via UART

Next time:
Install CCS and XCTU
Setup Git and create branches
Configure radios to communicate


2/18/19
Colin, Max
Max setup Github and is waiting to join
Max installed XCTU
Max talked to COlin about the math behind the mesh network
Were able to get two radios to run a sucessful distance check!!! (see video for settings)

Next Time:
Try to make the radios communicate with each other using UART
Max can bring his XMEGA from uP to test UART on radios (more familiar than MSP430 for now)
Get Juan to setup Github and install XCTU


2/19/19
Max, Juan
Max talked to Juan about project overview
Max looked into RF module configuration
We need to determine necessary initialization for UART communication
Juan researched power approximate power consumption and battery requirements.

Next Time:
Build breadboard for RF
Find necessary configurations

2/20/19
Juan, Richard
Acquired breadboards, wire kit
Wired breadboards
Explored XCTU

Next time:
Inventory all hardware
Configure a mesh network

2/22/2019
Colin, Richard
Configured the Xbees for digimesh
Got 2-way communication to work (sent packets)
Thought we bricked a radio when updating the magic firmware, but the board started working magically again
Looked into the possibility of using Micropython to code the Xbee

Next time:
Learn about the digimesh network protocol
Find out about the different device rolls
Figure out how to send packets without using the computer
Maybe figure out the Mircopython?
Attempt to connect a 3rd radio

2/25/2019
Colin, Max
Learned the command language and how to configure the Xbee via the terminal
Can use this to configure and write commands with UART on the micro controller

Next time:
Configure UART on the MSP430
Attempt to use UART to communicate with the Xbee

2/26/2019
Max, Juan
Max unsuccessfully attempted to have two Zigbees communicate with each other over uart through a microcontroller
Juan researched how to configure uart on the MSP 430

Next time:
Configure zigbee uart
Finish MSP430 uart config
