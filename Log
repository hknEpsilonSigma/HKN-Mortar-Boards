2/15/19
Colin, Richard
Setup Git repository
Installed CCS and XCTU
Connected to XBee3 via UART

Next time:
Install CCS and XCTU
Setup Git and create branches
Configure radios to communicate


2/18/19
Colin, Max
Max setup Github and is waiting to join
Max installed XCTU
Max talked to COlin about the math behind the mesh network
Were able to get two radios to run a sucessful distance check!!! (see video for settings)

Next Time:
Try to make the radios communicate with each other using UART
Max can bring his XMEGA from uP to test UART on radios (more familiar than MSP430 for now)
Get Juan to setup Github and install XCTU


2/19/19
Max, Juan
Max talked to Juan about project overview
Max looked into RF module configuration
We need to determine necessary initialization for UART communication
Juan researched power approximate power consumption and battery requirements.

Next Time:
Build breadboard for RF
Find necessary configurations

2/20/19
Juan, Richard
Acquired breadboards, wire kit
Wired breadboards
Explored XCTU

Next time:
Inventory all hardware
Configure a mesh network
